# Starter App vs. Welcome App
- Starter App can be used as a starting point for new web2py apps instead of the Welcome app
- Starter App is based on the AdminLTE Template and Bootstrap
- You can log in using "admin" and "password" to explore the template at mjbeller.pythonanywhere.com/starter
- You can get the code at github.com/mjbeller/web2py-starter

# Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/mjbeller/web2py-starter.git starter 
OR 
download https://github.com/mjbeller/web2py-starter/archive/master.zip
- go to /initialize/adminuser in your browser to create test users and groups (only works from localhost)

# Important Notes:
- Starter App is currently maintained on web2py current master branch
- appconfig.ini IS included in the git repo (I recommend removing for production)
- when you first install on localhost, you can access /initialize/adminuser to create initial admin user and auth_groups
- models includes some sample tables for Dogs, Persons, and Dog Owners which you can easily delete
